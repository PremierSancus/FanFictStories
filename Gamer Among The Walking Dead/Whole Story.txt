Welcome to the world of the walking dead. Your character’s stats and attributes had been selected for you. Say character screen out loud or mentally to look at it.

Was the words in the screen that greeted me. ‘huh I’m a gamer now. Walking dead.... nice could’ve been better though. This part about my stats and attributes being chosen for me sucks though. Hey game are you responsive to my thoughts?’

Recommended that you check your stats and attributes. You can do this by saying stats or thinking the word character screen very strongly.

‘I’ll take that as a yes then. Later when I level up can I assign stat points and raise each stats through exercising and studying?’

‘okay since the game doesn’t look too responsive I guess I'll just do what it says. Character screen’

Overall there was nothing but good news in the character screen. I look at the square brackets next to inventory, abilities and perks. Failing to figure what it was he pressed Inventory.

no items.

Now knowing what the square brackets are for he pressed the little red x in the top right corner.

You are gonna wake up once you exit this notification. The current date is 1 day before out break. You may mentally say exit to exit.

‘EXIT’ I thought then I became aware of my body. I get up of my bed and look around the room. The whole room was messy nothing was organized. It looked like the room was never cleaned for at least 2 months. There was a big mirror beside the door. I went in front in front of it looked at what I looked like. I couldn’t rate what I looked. I looked like the person one would get if they search average Spanish person. Not Latino, Spaniard a person from Spain. I had black short hair, thick eyebrows , black eyes. That’s it, that’s about how I can describe my face. My body was comparable to the average American back in the 1970s in build. My height however I couldn’t know cause I haven’t measured it yet. Trying to find a way to measure it I look around I see flip flops with a tag still on them checking. I see that the tag says 12 inches. Using that as a base I start measuring myself with the flip flops.

+1 wisdom for improvising with the flip flops.

“Nice” I say out loud. Didn’t know was this easy to bring up my stats. Putting one of the flip flops vertically on my feet. I count one in my head. I was about to move the one flip flop up when I thought of a better way.

+1 wisdom for finding a better way to use the flip flops as a measuring tool.

Thinking exit to exit the notification I put the other flip flop on top of the flip flop on my hands. Then I repeated the cycle. I was about 6 and 1/4 flip flops. Which means I am around 6’3 which is pretty tall in my view. Pretty tall since I was only 5’9 as an Asian and I was already pretty tall among my pears in my hometown. Realizing that I’m in a game I immediately try to go outside to see where I am. To make a plan that I’m not gonna follow later. Upon holding on the door a notification pops up.

You are not done exploring the game features to finish tutorial say or think Menu. I comply and think ’MENU’.

Character

Press or think Options to open it. Pressing Options the pop up changes again. It showed subtitles turned off, health off, and notification pop up option at full display. Deciding to set things right I turn subtitles on, health on putting a body and with a green colour and notification to a small circle on my sight. I test the health thing by punching the brick wall by the window. The fist of the character in my top left corner became yellow green. Deciding to test if I can sleep the damage off I go to bed. The notification circle gets a number on it’s side I think of opening it and it opened. The circle became a very long rectangle with numbers. The number one having bed on its side. Thinking about the bed notification it expands even further becoming one like the original notification.

How long would you like to sleep think of the number of hours and/or minutes you want. ‘ 1 hour’ I thought and immediately I blacked out. I woke up again and saw a notification in the circle. I did the whole process and another notification replaced the previous one opening it I read. It said that my fist had fully healed. Satisfied with the experiment I exit Options. I then check Shop there I found a lot of things. Apparently I was part of an open multiverse the shop had a lot of people inside it offering many items. It seems that all prices were the same for each items. I search for food and voila I see one very cheap one too. $1 per 6 packs of MRE I take it to experiment with the shop. The notification said that it was in my inventory. I check the inventory and it’s right there. So with all the game features figured out I go out of the doors I was at Fodder city day 15 of the outbreak. The only thing going in my mind. ‘Fodder city? Where the hell’s that!?’. I knew that day fifteen was good for me since it’s around the time that the government in USA fell apart. I look around the hallway. I think I am living in an apartment fairly intact too all the doors open making it more convenient for me. I started looting the place I found a lot of blankets and bed sheets. I finally found a map checking where the heck Fodder city is. I find that it is directly below a huge forest from Tennessee. It is located in Georgia just north of that city Atlanta where the beginning of season 1 happened. I get notified that I gained 1 intelligence for figuring out the geography surrounding Fodder city. Finishing my looting spree in the apartment I get 1 wisdom for doing so. I use some of the blankets to make a make shift armour for me. Ready to go outside I open the door leading to outside and Immediately the apartment is flooded with a lot of them I run to to the stairs so that I can fend them off more easily. The zombies being clumsy things were half the time climbing the stairs and falling off the stairs every step they did. I bash the nearest zombie in the head with hammer I have. I fend them off again and again though it wasn’t enough cause the zombie herd was slowly pushing me up luckily the apartment was three stories high and I was still at the sixth step. For what seemed like a lot of time I continue killing the zombies and eventually the trickle of zombies stopped. I check my notification it said four things.

You killed a zombie + 5 xp

Amount of zombies = 81

Total XP earned from killing zombies = 405

Total XP = 405

The other one was a notification about stat gains. It said that I gained 5 strength from all the swinging of the hammer. 2 dexterity from trying to dodge zombie attacks. 1 int from getting to know how to use the hammer effectively against the zombie. Strangely though I didn’t get wisdom for using the stairs which meant that gaining wisdom from simple decisions won’t increase it anymore.

The second last notification was about me gaining a proficiency in both hammer and zombie killing. The last one was a level up notification I gained 4 levels making me level 5 which gave me 1 PP.  I look at my character screen.

Looking at the options I debate on the three perks available to me. Lean wasn’t useful at the moment I would get it later though. Sixth sense and quests on the other hand both were useful. On the other hand quests would make levelling up faster and it would give rewards that could be useful. With Sixth sense though it will make surviving much easier. Since surviving was the whole point of this universe I pick sixth sense. Finished reviewing my character screen I start looting the corpses. I grab the one nearest to me and started stripping it. Thinking if I could put the entire thing in my inventory I try it and it worked. Checking the inventory I see that the items with corpse was immediately separated from the corpse. Getting an idea i check the shop for the prices of a zombie corpse. Each zombie corpse were worth a lot. A zombie corpse was worth 2 dollars each and with 81 zombie corpse I sell it. Immediately I get the money after putting it on the shop. I notice that I only get 81 instead of what I expected. I conclude that like any other game the shop would sell you twice the price for the price they give you or they pay you half the price for what you give them. Deciding not to risk a situation like it again I go to the highest room in the apartment and look around from the top. The place the door the zombies went though were separated from the street with a fence. It seems the only thing that stopped all the zombies from the streets flooding in was a car that plugged the gap between the fence. I check the back of the apartment it wasn’t very packed so I choose to go out from there. From the apartment I decide to go deeper in the city.

2 Days Later deep in Fodder city

I had looted multiple jewellery stores and sold them in the past 2 days. I also encountered 2 gun shops and looted a police station. I earned around $100,000 in the 2 days I spent in the city. Most of the things I sold were items that you couldn’t use for fighting like jewellery. I also got a big amount of guns from the gun shops. I got an assortment of equipment from the police station either lying around or worn by the dead policemen. Looking around at the den I have made for myself I quietly appreciated it. I have made what I think is the perfect experience farm. The place was a small restaurant near a big hotel. I light up the hotel during night to attract zombies from far away. While I use loud speakers to attract the nearby zombies to my fortified restaurant. I made a pulley system that drops and lifts a very sturdy door at the entrance. The door was put in a slot that I made. The slot was made of wood and screwed to the wall and the floor. It was made so I can make zombies come in when I needed to practice my melee weapons or shooting skills really close to the enemies. There was a ladder leading to the roof of the restaurant. There I could practice my shooting skills from far away. I preferred the method of letting the zombies in to kill them though it allowed me to gain money after I killed zombies even though it took more time to gain experience. On the roof was also the exit I use I made a series of bridges and ramps that I use to travel the block. Each of the buildings on the block I put ladders in alleys where zombies don’t go too often.

Deciding it was time for another zombie killing I pull the chains lifting the door. I then hook the chains on a bent metal bar in the farthest end of the restaurant. I count the number of zombies that goes in and wait till there’s a hundred of them. Releasing the chains from the hook the door drops and kills one of the zombies. I then equip a long-sword I bought from the shop. I remembered that zombies or walkers as the main characters of this universe calls them are unbelievably weak against blades. I decided I’d buy a sword so since it is a good idea. So I bought the long-sword then I remembered that long-swords weren’t very good at extremely close range so I also bought a roundel dagger. Roundel daggers were primarily stabbing weapons and since most of the actions you see in the TV series was stabbing. I picked a roundel dagger. With the first few zombies closing in a make wide vertical slice with my long-sword decapitating four of them in one swing. Which is impossible in real life but this is the walking dead where you could easily cut through skulls with a sword. I continue doing calculated swings till a heavily armoured police zombie comes my way. I know that I could do a weapon switch faster by equipping the dagger but I was training to hide my gamer abilities when I eventually show myself to the inhabitants of this world so I instead throw the long-sword away from the walkers and drew my dagger.  I hold out my hand and grab it’s helmet. Controlling it’s movements I lift the visor and stick my dagger through it’s eye. Sheathing the dagger back I take a sprint to my long-sword and repeat the routine of great wide swings killing multiple walkers at each time. Finishing the last of the 100 that came in I begin putting them all in the inventory. After that selling them, I then repeat the process 5 more times and then go to the roof or the hotel to practice shooting. I decided to practice shooting the sniper rifles I got. Since I had a level 3 on my Weapon Proficiency: Rifles I could shoot a walker’s head 100% of the time within 105 meters or 115 yards. I go to the top of the hotel which is above the 20th floor giving me a distance of around 70 meters from the ground. Taking out a hunting rifle I aim at the building I know is around a 100 meters away over all giving me around 120 meters of distance to shoot at. Good enough of a distance to increase the level of my Weapon Proficiency: Rifles into 4. I fire 60 times before going back to the roof of the restaurant via a bridge in the second floor of the hotel. Done doing my experience farming I go outside and head to the nearest gym to increase my stats. Practising my driving skills with a car along the way.  At the gym I use all the non electronic machines. I use the barbell and do squats with them to increase my strength. After 3 hours of non-stop exercise I go back to the restaurant using a motorcycle to practice in it. Before going to bed I check the notification my Weapon Proficiency: Long-sword had gone up by 2 making me have level 22 in it. The skill didn’t really specify what each level up does so I only practice it with the zombies. My skill in rifles also had gone up 2 times. This skill did specify, Each level up increased my 100% accuracy range with rifles by 35 meters or around 38.5 yards each time. Of course if the gun itself is not so accurate like a musket for example I won’t have that 100% accuracy. Looking at the other notification I notice the rest of the notification was just a level up and stat gain one so. I open my character screen.

I’m met with two extremely good options again. Even though I promised myself that I will get quests the next time I get a perk the idea of being able to buy things from other universes is really appealing so. I pick the Other Worldly Shopper perk giving me access to items from other universes. Immediately after picking it I go to the armour section and use the filter to take out none indestructible items. I look at the cheapest one it was a shirt made out of vibranium and it was worth 3 million dollars. Dejected I won’t have indestructible armour I decide to save up for it. I make a list of items I could sell that will give me big money in a short period of time. I then set to memorize each one of them and for the next 40 days that’s what I do missing the chance of me meeting rick in King County.

30 Days Later deep in Fodder city

I finally earned enough money to buy that vibranium long sleeved shirt and leggings. Which is now my undergarments. It costed me a total of 13 million dollars just for those two sets but they were worth it. Since it is made of vibranium I am now protected from any physical attacks directed at my arms, torso and legs. Them being made of an unknown variant of vibranium it always stays at room temperature. It releases the energy in its bond out when ever it comes in contact with temperature lower than room temperature warming me up if it gets cold. Absorbs the heat around it when the temperature is higher than room temperature giving me a nifty heat and cooling system along with under garments that are almost invincible in this universe. Almost because like any other vibranium it has a limit. The limit of mine is being hit by a tank round, head on 4 consecutive times. I know this because it says so in its description. I also finally figured out how the level up system works. It first started with 10 xp to become level 2 and then it needed 40 to become level 3 and then 90 for level 4. The pattern was that every level up it needed the previous xp required plus 20. so I killed individual zombies until I reached level 14. Signifying that I killed at least 8,190 zombies in the 30 days I spent here. From there I calculated that I need to kill 1960 to level up into 15. So I counted the batches of 100 zombies that I let in the restaurant for me to kill. So far I did 19 batches telling me that this batch will the one that gets my level up. I pull the chains in the door to let zombies in to kill the last batch of 100 that I will need to level up. 20 minutes later I finish killing the last of the 100 I let in and open my character screen to get the quest perk.
